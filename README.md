# CurrencyConverter
This currency converter project is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It uses an public API, to fetch data about the exchange rates.
It may not result in the exact calculations as the rates are fluctuating in nature and the API is not refreshed everytime, but it can give you and approximate idea.
